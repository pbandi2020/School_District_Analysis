# Results
### School Data Analysis Report
1.  **District summary affected** - When the leadership looks at this data the overall success rate is below 65% and the average scores are not very promising or competivite. Looking at this data the leadership cannot really make any operational changes. This data is a 10,000 foot view and not enough metric to help make business decisions but just enough to question on next level of information needed.
2.  **School summary affected** - This is a good overview of overall performance by school but just not enough information for leadership to say why certain school is performing well and why others are not. This is where slicing of scores by grade, school size, etc would help take a deeper look to analyze the performance trends and perform a gap analysis.
3.  **Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools** - As the board though the data reported for THS was not accurate and removed the 9th grade scores improved the performance scale by 25% which shows a positive trent and narrows the problem area to focus on.
4.  **Replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following(Math & Readding grades, School Spending, School Size & Type):** Removing of 9th grade scores for THS has no impact on School Size, Type and Spending analysis report. Math & Reading scores are the only area affected and the affect is postive trend and helps leadership focus relooking at 9th grade for THS.

                                                                                                                                                                     
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Syntax and understing the logical flow was the most challenging part. Some of the instructions were very confusing.
