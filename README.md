1.  How is the district summary affected?

3.  How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
4.  How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* I am fairly new to Python programming and hence getting the right syntax, understanding the error and debugging was the most challenging part of this exercise but the exampled is the module was very helpful in getting to completion of the project. 

### Summary
#### *Summary based on the data available*
* Total Casted Votes is **306,055**
* County that received highest turnoround is **Denver**
* Winner of the election is **Diana DeGette**

#### *Additional data points for future enahancement and what are it's benefits*
1. To be accurate in determining a winner, the candidate results must be broken by 2 dimensions (county & candidate).
2. Candidate do not contest in multiple counties but, our result by candidate is taking all counties into account when determining a winner for Colorado. Hence declaring a winner by total registered votes across counties is not a proper way of determining a winner of the elections. 
3. Fianlly, since we do not know how many registered voters are there is each county, we cannot really determine the percentage of votes recorded. In other words **Expected Vs Registered**
