# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Project
This project is focused on providing a School District Summary to the district leadership board. The data from this report will help the dstrict to,

1. View overall district performance based on students succcess rate. 
2. View of success rate by school to help analyze which school is falling behind.
3. View of scusses rate by school & grade level to help analyze where is the gap and why? 
4. View of budget allocated per school and per student and compare the success trent to help make next fiscal year budget decisions
5. View of success rate by school size 

All of the above metric are key decision points for leaddership in making dedcsions to help improve the overall district school rating and improving the quality of education and achiving the goal of no child left behind objective.
  


# Results
### School Data Analysis Report
1.  District summary affected - When the leadership looks at this data the overall success rate is below 65% and the average scores are not very promising or competivite. Looking at this data the leadership cannot really make any operational changes. This data is a 10,000 foot view and not enough metric to help make business decisions bt just enough to question on next level of information needed.
2.  School summary affected - This is a good overview of overall performance by school but just not enough information for leadership to say why certain school is performing well and why others are not. This is where slicing the grades by grade, school size, etc woudl help take a deeper look to analyze the performance trends and performance a gap analysis.
3.  Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools - As the board though the data reported for THS was not accurate and removed the 9th grade grades improved the performance scale by 25% which shows a positive trent and narrows the problem area to focus on.
4.  How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following(Math & Readding grades, School Spending, School Size & Type):

                                                                                                                                                                      
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* I am fairly new to Python programming and hence getting the right syntax, understanding the error and debugging was the most challenging part of this exercise but the exampled is the module was very helpful in getting to completion of the project. 

### Summary
#### *Summary based on the data available*
* Total Casted Votes is **306,055**
* County that received highest turnoround is **Denver**
* Winner of the election is **Diana DeGette**

#### *Additional data points for future enahancement and what are it's benefits*
1. To be accurate in determining a winner, the candidate results must be broken by 2 dimensions (county & candidate).
2. Candidate do not contest in multiple counties but, our result by candidate is taking all counties into account when determining a winner for Colorado. Hence declaring a winner by total registered votes across counties is not a proper way of determining a winner of the elections. 
3. Fianlly, since we do not know how many registered voters are there is each county, we cannot really determine the percentage of votes recorded. In other words **Expected Vs Registered**
